<br>
<br>
"This capstone was truly a highlight of the DSCPE program. It offered a unique mix of mentorship, hands-on experience, and real-world application in a short timeframe. I gained so much in terms of skills and professional growth; thanks to both the guidance I received and the practical work I did along the way."
<br>
<br>
"The capstone was by far the best and most valuable aspect of the program. I will definitely continue to keep in touch and collaborate with my mentors."
<br>
<br>
"There was ample communication and support avenues provided and advertised throughout the entire course. I felt very supported even when my capstone project took a different path regarding timeline completion."

<br>
 “Overall great experience and I highly recommend this experience to others. I would certainly do it again!”
<br>
<br>
“This was less of a mentorship experience and more of a "co-thinking"/colleague interaction, which was great. The data system is new to our institution, so the student and I were learning and exploring together!”
<br>
<br>
“The program was very well thought out and I think if anything less might be more in the context of designing a project. There is so much knowledge, skills, and experience that can acquired through a focused capstone project and I think one thing that we did well was scaling back our original project design.“
