    <td><div><b>Ashlea Green</b> | Associate Professor and Metadata Librarian<br><em>Appalachian State University</em><br>Ashlea Green is an Associate Professor and Metadata Librarian at Appalachian State University. She holds an MS in Information Sciences from the University of Tennessee and an MA in Linguistics from Ohio University.

Her work also involves managing metadata standards and application profiles, developing instructional resources, and collaborating with colleagues to ensure the seamless integration of metadata across digital platforms. Ashlea is committed to enhancing the support her library can offer researchers, especially as Appalachian State was recently elevated to R2 status.

Through the DSCPE program, Ashlea hopes to build the expertise needed to help fill this gap and strengthen Appalachian State’s expanding research infrastructure. She lives in Asheville, NC with her spouse, two cats, and two dogs, and is excited to join the Fall 2025 DSCPE cohort.
