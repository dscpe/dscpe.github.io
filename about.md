#### <img src="/images/logos/DSCPElogo2.png"> <b> What is the DSCPE? </b>
The Data Services Continuing Professional Education (DSCPE) fills a much-needed gap in professional development of practicing librarians. 

The objective of this professional education is to train and develop a community of data services librarians. The curriculum is designed as a twelve-week online intensive learning experience geared toward preparing working professionals to provide needed data services. The DSCPE course delivery will involve online live sessions, remote self-paced learning, guest speakers, and capstone site mentors.

The DSCPE program adopts a Competency-Based Education/Training (CBE/CBT) approach. This non-traditional approach to education meets learners where they are and allows them to advance at their own pace. CBE/CBT  promotes equity and empowers learners to master learning outcomes in a flexible environment.

#### Why create the program?

Currently, research-intensive institutions are focusing on data reproducibility, data reuse, and data integrity. There are many partners and collaborators across institutions participating in this endeavor and librarians play an increasingly important role. The existing workforce needs to be retooled with training and hands-on experience in the area of research data services in order to support their research community.

The DSCPE is composed of three components occuring over twelve weeks:
